# About

YUL fines/fee payment application

# Start developing

```
git clone https://github.com/yorkulibraries/yulfines.git
cd yulfines

There are 3 containers created: **web**, **db** and **mailcatcher**

# Access the front end web app in DEVELOPMENT 

http://localhost:3004/

By default, the application will listen on port 3004 and runs with RAILS_ENV=development.

To access the application in Chrome browser, you will need to add the ModHeader extension to your Chrome browser.

Header: PYORK_USER
Value: admin (or manager or whatever user you want to mimic)

For convenience, you can import the ModHeader profile from the included ModHeader_admin.json.
